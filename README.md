# Cryptogram
A terminal-based game where you are initially given a few letters of a randomly generated quote--one that you must solve!

## How To Play
- These self-explanatory controls are always displayed in the terminal:

      ← : Move Left

      → : Move Right

      ↑ : Hint
  
      ↓ : Select

      Q : Quit

- An arrow is printed below the underscores to indicate the user's current position. 
- The game will continue to run until the user correctly fills out the puzzle or _Q_ is pressed.
